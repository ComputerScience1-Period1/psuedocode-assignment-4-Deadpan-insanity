At the start of the game, each player is dealt 5 cards; the remaining cards are placed in a stack in the center. 
The player to the left of the dealer then starts by asking another player if they have a certain rank of card;
While(!winner):
  If they do;
   That player is required to hand over all the cards of that rank that they have;
   Asking player may ask the same player or other players for a certain card;
  If they don’t;
   The player responds with “go fish” and the asker has to draw a card from the center;
   A player gains points by having 4 cards of the same rank (rank being 2-10, king, queen, joker and ace); 
  If a player has 4 cards of the same rank;
   They take all cards that apply from their deck and lay them together in front of them (which are called a book) which count as one point;
   The cards in the book cannot be taken away from the player.
  If they don’t;
   Turn passes to next player;
   
   When all cards are in books, the player with greatest amount of books wins;
