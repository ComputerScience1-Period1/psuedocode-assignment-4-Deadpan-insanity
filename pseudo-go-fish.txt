Go fish pseudo-code
At the start of the game, each player is dealt 5 cards; the remaining cards are placed in a stack in the center. 
The player to the left of the dealer then starts by asking another player if they have a certain rank of card; 
If they do;
 That player is required to hand over all the cards of that rank that they have;
If they don’t;
 The player responds with “go fish” and the asker has to draw a card from the center;
 A player gains points by having 2 or more cards of the same rank (rank being 2-10, king, queen, joker and ace); 
If a player has 2 or more cards of the same rank;
 They take all cards that apply from their deck and lay them together in front of them (which are called a book) which count as one point;
If they don’t;
 The game continues as normal;
